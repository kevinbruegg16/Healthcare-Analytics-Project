# Healthcare Analytics Competitor Analysis

This repository contains a group project completed as part of my Master of Science in Analytics program at LSU.  
The consulting team partnered with **Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC)** to conduct a competitor analysis, focusing on Medicare enrollment trends and identifying areas of opportunity in five states: **Texas, Illinois, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Montana**.

---

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Evaluate HCSC’s competitive position in the Medicare Advantage and Part D markets and identify opportunities for growth.  
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Enrollment numbers, plan offerings, and market penetration.
  - Effects of Cigna’s Medicare business acquisition on HCSC’s market share.
  - Social determinants of health (SDOH) as a driver of enrollment disparities.
  - Market sentiment and customer experience with HCSC vs. competitors.

## Data Sources & Methods
- **Data Sources**: Publicly available datasets from:
  - Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS.gov)  
  - U.S. Census Bureau  
  - American Community Survey (ACS)  

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Cleaning and imputation to address missing values.
  - Integration of multiple datasets within Tableau.
  - Validation against national Medicare enrollment benchmarks.

- **Analytical Methods**:
  - Enrollment & market penetration analysis.  
  - Geographic segmentation (high-opportunity counties & metro areas).  
  - Social determinants of health (SDOH) opportunity scoring.  
  - **AI-driven sentiment analysis** to assess consumer perceptions of HCSC and competitors.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence
- Conducted **sentiment analysis** of policy satisfaction, renewal intention, digital engagement, and coverage gaps.  
- Explored how AI could enhance insights, identify pain points, and complement traditional methods.  
- Delivered recommendations on applying **AI-driven dashboards** and **human-in-the-loop validation**.

## Key Findings
- **Opportunity Gaps**: ~101,000 eligible but unenrolled individuals across the five states represented untapped potential.  
- **High-Impact Markets**: Enrollment opportunities concentrated in major metros (Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Oklahoma City, Albuquerque, Billings).  
- **Social Determinants of Health**: Economic hardship, aging needs, and digital access strongly correlated with low enrollment.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**:  
  - Strengths: Policy satisfaction and renewal intentions were high.  
  - Weaknesses: Coverage gaps, claim denials, and digital service expectations required improvement.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize counties with high SDOH Opportunity Scores for plan expansion and supplemental benefits.  
- Reassure customers during the Cigna acquisition with clear, transparent messaging.  
- Introduce value-added services (fitness, dental/vision upgrades) to strengthen retention.  
- Leverage AI for **real-time feedback loops** and **enhanced customer engagement**.

## My Role
- Led **data cleaning and wrangling**, ensuring consistency across CMS and Census datasets.  
- Conducted **AI-based sentiment analysis** of HCSC and competitor customer experiences.  
- Assisted with **slide design** and visual storytelling for executive presentation delivery.
